Requirements
- ESX
- vSync (MF fork)
- InteractSound (MF fork)

Installation
- 1. Drag and drop into into resource folder.
- 2. Start vSync, InteractSound, then MF_Purge in server.cfg (in that order)
- 3. Check config.lua for settings that you might need to change.
- 4. Join https://discord.gg/ukgQa5K to be activated to use script (user activations happen twice a day in bulk - so it may take upto 24 hours to get this processed)

Usage
- type /purge in-game. The event will start at 6 PM and continue until 8 AM.

Notes
- All players recieve a weapon when the purge starts.
- AI spawn around the map.
- Some armored vehicles spawn around the map.
- Ammo boxes spawn in legion square, and players who loot them get a weapon to keep after the purge has finished.
- The ammo boxes respawn.
- If players disconnect, or when purge finishes, purge weapons are removed from players.
- If player dies near legion square, they're teleported to one of four random locations (you can add more).
- AI and vehilces should be deleted. Sometimes it doesn't want to work.
- If you want more AI classes, just add them in config.lua.
